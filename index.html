<h1> Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="subtext">
         <h3> The Path to the Internet </h3>
          <p> We interact with the internet through our computer and browser. The browser is a program that displays files on the web, intepreting them to show us what we see. The internet is essentially the world's largest computer, pulling files from servers though HTTP from the servers. Servers are essentially large computers that hold the files that make up the internet and sends them though the internet to our computers.  </p> 
  </div>
      <div class="subtext">
          <h3>A Basic Understanding of HTML's place in the Internet </h3>
            <p> The Web is made up of mainly HTML documents. 
            HTML stands for hypertext markup language and works essentially as the glue for everything else on the internet.
            There are five types of files on the web: <em> plain text, HTML, images, videos, and music </em>. HTML allows for hyperlinks, making the web "web-like".
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subtext">
          <h3>What makes up HTML?</h3>
            <p> HTML is made up of four elements. What you see is referred to as the text content. How the text content is displayed to you is the mark up. Links to other pages or reference to other documents like images and videos are how it helps the internet. 

            This is well-explained <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> here </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A HTML markup is made up of the name of the tag, the content of the tag, and the end of the tag. This is explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> video. </a> </p> 
  </div>
      <div class="subtext">

          <h3> Inline Tags</h3>
              <p> There are two types of tags: <em> inline</em> and <em> block</em>.
                  </p>
              <p>

              Inline tags are just tags that affect the text while block tags group together text that can be altered together, essentially putting them into boxes with height and width. <br>
              Common inline tags change the text so you can put them into italics and bold. How to use the bold tag is in this <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48011976/m-48703273"> video.</a>. How to use the italics tag is in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48296546/m-48693677"> video </a>
             . 
              <br> 
              Another commonly used inline tag is attributes. This is how I linked all of the videos in this site. You can learn how to make them in this  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48508417/m-48723411"> video </a>
            .
            <br>
            Having images is just as simple with a little change. Image tags, like the break tag (used to add breaks in the text n the white space on the page) are void tags, meaning they don't need a closing tag.
            Adding images is shown <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48744041"> here</a>
            . The concept of white space would be hard to explain on this limited text so just watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48666064/m-48678767"> this </a>.  
            .

              </p> 
<h3> Block Tags</h3>
<p> Block tags have already been mentioned as different from inline tags. One commonly used block tag is the paragraph tag. This is used to group together text into a block. All of the text under a section heading, before another section heading here has been placed into a paragraph tag.  If you are still confused by the difference, watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-4872343"> this</a>

       <h3> Computers are stupid.</h3>
          <p> One that should not be forgotten is that the computer is stupid. Only the correct syntax will be understood properly by the computer. And do not feel stupid if you do not remember how to do something in HTML. That's what google is for. </p>

    <h3>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
      <p>A webpage is made up like a house. HTML is like the walls of the house.
        CSS controls how the house looks, like the color of the walls. Javascript shapes how 
        one interacts with the house, like a garage opener.

      <h3>Exploring the Web</h3>
        <p>Not all elements of the web is visible but all that is visible is in a rectangle. 
          Even other shapes are in a box, making rearranging web interfaces a lot simplier.
        </p>
        <p>A HTML document can be broken down into a tree-like structure. This tree-like structures also means that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. This structure would show up in a series of nested boxes. 
          This is explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3555039510/e-2771378561/m-2771378562"> video.</a>

          Important Vocabulary:
           <ul>
          <li> <b>HTML</b>: standard mark up language used to create webpages </li>
          <li> <b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets): style sheet language used for describing look and formatting of document written in mark-up language/li>
          <li> <b>DOM</b> (Document Object Model): a cross platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with object in HTML and other makeup language, nodes in the document organized in tree structure is DOM tree</li>

    <h2> 
      Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure
    </h2>
      <h3>
        What is CSS?
      </h3>
         <p>
           CSS is the decoration of the walls, displaying the HTML in the way desired. It is applied as the law of the website with a concept called <span class="em"> inheritance </span>. What this means is that properties are applied to a specificed element as well as any continuing ones, essentially the entire page. CSS is a great way to avoid repetition so programmers don't have to write the same code over and over. It also avoids problems that can arise from repeated code since every code needs to be adjusted. Using CSS will just change everything in one go.  
         </p>
       <h3>
           How does CSS control HTML? 
      </h3>
        <p>
          With a selection, declaration, value and property. The section could be a heading tag or div class tag. This concept has been explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2663568566/m-2616578593"> video. </a>
      </p>

       There are three methods of adding CSS Styling to a Webpage:
        <ul>
          <li>Method 1: Writing CSS in the head tag of your HTML</li>
          <li>Method 2: Link your HTML to separate CSS file</li>
          <li> Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>
        Using Semantic Tags
      </h2>
      <p> 
            Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display the HTML elements. There is a need to standardize it. This is explained better in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2811608545/m-2810478547"> video. </a> Using a prefix in your CSS code can also modify the code for different browsers.

      <h2> 
        The Box Revisited: Vocabulary List
      </h2>

         <ul>
          <li> Content: This box deals with how the text is displayed.</li>
          <li>Padding: This box deals with everything around the content, including the background.</li>
          <li> Margin: The box is the space between boxes.</li>
        </ul>

        This is well explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2771378569/m-2792478544">

          <h2> Adjusting Boxes 
          </h2>
          <p>
            By setting the size of the boxes to percentages, the page will adjust for changing window size. 
          </p>
          <h3> Box Sizing </h3>

            <ul>
          <li> 1. HTML elements are just boxes with each box made up of 4 components..</li>
          <li> 2. It is often hard to get the size of the box just right because of the variety of components in each box. </li>
          <li> 3. There are two techniques as to how you can deal with sizing issues: setting sizes to percentages (as mentioned earlier) and setting box=sizing attibute to border-box for each element. </li>
          <li> 4. Different browsers work slightly different. This causes different dispays from the same code. </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="subtext">
      <h2> Box Positioning </h2>
        <p>
          Using the div tag as a block element makes it difficult since it takes up the entire width of the page. Adding a rule display:flex to the appropriate CSS can override this issue. </p>
      </div>

    <div class="subtext">
      <h2> Adding image </h2>

         <ul>
          <li>1. Make a folder and put your image in it.</li>
          <li>2. Add to HTML with the img tag.</li>
          <li> 3. Always use alternative wording in case the image doesn't show up. </li>
      </ul> 

      </div>
    <div class="subtext">

      <h2> Review </h2>
        -Remember to box up everything you see and size those boxes. 
       <ul>
          <li> 1. Look for natural boxes.</li>
          <li>2. Look for repeated sytles and semantic elements. </li>
          <li> 3. Write the HTML. </li>
         <li> 4. Apply styles from biggest to smallest.</li>
         <li> 5. Fix things. </li>
         <li> 6. Repeat 3 and 4 until it works in multiple browsers and looks the desired way.</li>
        </ul>       
      </div>
